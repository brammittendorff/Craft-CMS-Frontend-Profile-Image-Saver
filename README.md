# Craft CMS Frontend Profile Image Saver
You need to use a REST client and create a post to your plugin. (remember posting will only work in dev mode, because if it is live you will need ajax calls)

call to url:

/actions/aviaryFrontend/image/saveImage

payload:

url=http%3A%2F%2Florempixel.com%2F400%2F200%2F

after url= you can enter a image url:

url=[IMAGE URL]
